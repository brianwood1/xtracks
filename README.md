# xtracks
Software for the analysis of human movement patterns. 

<b>xtracks</b> provides tools for the visualization and analysis of spatiotemporal data describing human movement patterns (real or simulated). 
This tool is built with social scientists and ecologists studying human movement using GPS data in mind. 
xtracks is in active development and new measures of individual and collective movement and social interaction will be added over time. 
This version (0.1.0) produces measures including daily distances traveled, sinuosity of travel paths, raster measures of landscape use, and rates of habitat exploration.
