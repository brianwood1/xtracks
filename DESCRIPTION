Title: Xtracks: Software for Analysis of Movement and Socio-Spatial Patterns
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Brian Wood
Maintainer: Brian Wood <brianwood1@gmail.com>
Description: xtracks provides tools for the visualization and analysis of spatiotemporal data describing human movement patterns (real or simulated). This tool is built with social scientists and ecologists studying human movement using GPS data in mind. It produces measures of individual and collective movement and social interaction. These measures include daily distances traveled, raster measures of landscape use, inter-individual proximities, sinuosity of travel paths, rates of habitat exploration, and measures of geographic segregation and overlap between tracks. It is written to be data source agnostic, and can handle either field data or simulated data generated from an agent based model. Some custom data import and export routines are also provided.
